/*Distinguishing Between Overloaded Methods

The compiler distinguishes overloaded methods by their signaturesâ€”a combination of the method's
 name and the number, types and order of its parameters, but not its return type. Return Types of 
 Overloaded Methods In discussing the logical names of methods used by the compiler, we did not mention 
 the return types of the methods. Method calls cannot be distinguished only by return type. If you had overloaded 
 methods that differed only by their return types and you called one of the methods in a standalone statement as in:
  square(2); the compiler would not be able to determine the version of the method to call, because the return value is ignored.
   Compiler issues an arror. */
