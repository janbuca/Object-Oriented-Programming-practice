    Assembling Strings with String Concatenation
        Java allows you to assemble String objects into larger strings by using operators + or +=.
        This is known as string concatenation. When both operands of operator + are String objects, operator + creates a new String object in which the characters of the right operand are placed at the end of those in the left operandâ€”e.g., the expression "hello " + "there" creates the String "hello there".
        Every primitive value and object in Java can be represented as a String. When one of the + operator's operands is a String, the other is converted to a String, then the two are concatenated. Primitive values used in String concatenation are converted to Strings.
        A boolean concatenated with a String is converted to the String "true" or "false".
        All objects have a toString method that returns a String representation of the object. e.g.
