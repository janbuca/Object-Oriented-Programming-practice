The do...while repetition statement is similar to the while statement.
    In the while, the program tests the loop-continuation condition at the beginning of the loop, before executing the loop's body; if the condition is false, the body never executes.
    The doâ€¦while statement tests the loop-continuation condition after executing the loop's body; therefore, the body always executes at least once.
    When a do...while statement terminates, execution continues with the next statement in sequence.
