We have already discussed about the if single-selection statement and the if…else double-selection statement.
The switch multiple-selection statement performs different actions based on the possible values of a constant integral expression of type byte, short, int or char.

break
    In addition to selection and repetition statements, Java provides statements break (which we discussed in the context of the switch statement)and continue to alter the flow of control.
    The preceding section showed how break can be used to terminate a switch statement’s execution.

        int count; // control variable also used after loop terminates

        for (count = 1; count <= 10; count++) // loop 10 times
        {
        if (count == 5)
        break;
        System.out.printf("%d ", count);
        }
        System.out.printf("%nBroke out of loop at count = %d%n", count);
        1 2 3 4 Broke out of loop at count = 5
