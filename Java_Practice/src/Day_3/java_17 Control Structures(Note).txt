Control Structures- if single statement
    Normally, statements in a program are executed one after the other in the order in which they're written.
    This process is called sequential execution.

Various Java statements, which we'll soon discuss, enable you to specify that the next statement to execute is not necessarily the next one in sequence.
This is called transfer of control.

Bohm and Jacopini's work demonstrated that all programs could be written in terms of only three control structures:

the sequence structure,
the selection structure and
the repetition structure.
if Single-Selection Statement

Programs use selection statements to choose among alternative courses of action.

For example, suppose that the passing grade on an exam is 80.
